# 🚨 NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT FIX INSTRUCTIONS

## Current Issue: 404 - Page Not Found

The deployment is failing because Netlify needs to be configured to deploy from the `frontend/` directory.

## ✅ Quick Fix - Update Netlify Settings:

### Option 1: Change Netlify Site Settings (Recommended)
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard: https://app.netlify.com
2. Open your site: **stately-licorice-5078da**
3. Go to **Site settings** → **Build & deploy** → **Build settings**
4. Change these settings:
   - **Base directory**: Leave blank OR set to `frontend`
   - **Publish directory**: `frontend`
   - **Build command**: `echo "Static site - no build required"`

### Option 2: Deploy from Frontend Directory Only
1. In Netlify dashboard, go to **Deploys**
2. Click **Deploy manually**
3. Drag ONLY the `frontend/` folder (not the whole repository)
4. The site will work immediately!

## 📁 What Should Be Deployed:
Your Netlify site should serve these files from the `frontend/` directory:
- `ledart-index.html` (main app)
- `ledart-style.css` (styling)
- `ledart-app.js` (functionality)
- `index.html` (redirect page)
- `_redirects` (routing rules)
- `netlify.toml` (configuration)

## 🎯 Expected Result:
After fixing the publish directory, your LED Board Controller will be available at:
`https://stately-licorice-5078da.netlify.app`

## 🔧 Alternative Solution:
If the above doesn't work, you can:
1. Create a new Netlify site
2. Use "Deploy manually" 
3. Drag the `frontend/` folder directly
4. It will work instantly!

**The application is fully functional - it just needs the correct deployment directory!**
